        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Segyio is a small LGPL licensed C library for easy interaction with SEG Y
        formatted seismic data, with language bindings for Python and Matlab. Segyio is
        an attempt to create an easy-to-use, embeddable, community-oriented library for
        seismic applications. Features are added as they are needed; suggestions and
        contributions of all kinds are very welcome.
        
        Feature summary
        ---------------
         * A low-level C interface with few assumptions; easy to bind to other
           languages.
         * Read and write binary and textual headers.
         * Read and write traces, trace headers.
         * Easy to use and native-feeling python interface with numpy integration.
        
        Project goals
        -------------
        
        Segyio does necessarily attempt to be the end-all of SEG-Y interactions;
        rather, we aim to lower the barrier to interacting with SEG-Y files for
        embedding, new applications or free-standing programs.
        
        Additionally, the aim is not to support the full standard or all exotic (but
        correctly) formatted files out there. Some assumptions are made, such as:
        
         * All traces in a file are assumed to be of the same sample size.
         * It is assumed all lines have the same number of traces.
        
        The writing functionality in Segyio is largely meant to *modify* or adapt
        files. A file created from scratch is not necessarily a to-spec SEG-Y file, as
        we only necessarily write the header fields segyio needs to make sense of the
        geometry. It is still highly recommended that SEG-Y files are maintained and
        written according to specification, but segyio does not mandate this.
