"""segyio

Welcome to segyio. For help, examples and reference, type ``help(function)`` in
your favourite python interpreter, or ``pydoc function`` in the unix console.

The segyio library attempts to be easy to use efficently for prototyping and
interaction with possibly large segy files. File reading and writing is
streaming, with large file support out of the box and without hassle. For a
quick start on reading files, type ``help(segyio.open)``.

An open segy file is interacted with in modes. For a reference with examples,
please type ``help(segyio.segy)``, look at the online documentation at
segyio.readthedocs.io, or run ``help()`` on the object returned by
``segyio.open``.. For documentation on individual modes, please
refer to the individual modes with ``help(f.[mode])``, where ``f`` is an open
file handle.

The available modes are:
    * text, for textual headers including extended headers
    * bin, for the binary header
    * header, for the trace headers
    * trace, for trace data
    * iline, for inline biased operations
    * xline, for crossline biased operations
    * depth_slice, for depth biased operations
    * gather, for gather/intersaction biased operations

The primary data type is the numpy.ndarray. All examples use ``np`` for the
numpy namespace. That means that any function that returns a trace, a set of
samples or even full lines, returns a numpy.ndarray. This enables quick and
easy mathematical operations on the data you care about.

Segyio is designed to blend into regular python code, so python concepts that
map to segy operations are written to behave similarly. That means that
sequences of data support list lookup, slicing (``f.trace[0:10:2]``), ``for x
in`` etc. Please refer to the individual modes' documentation for a more
extensive set of examples.

For all slicing operations that segyio provides the underlying buffer is
reused, so if you want to keep the data between iterations it is necessary to
manually copy the data, e.g. ``numpy.copy()``. Please refer to the examples.
