    The Trace implements the array interface, where every array element, the
    data trace, is a numpy.ndarray. As all arrays, it can be random accessed,
    iterated over, and read strided. Data is read lazily from disk, so
    iteration does not consume much memory. If you want eager reading, use
    Trace.raw.

    This mode gives access to reading and writing functionality for traces.
    The primary data type is ``numpy.ndarray``. Traces can be accessed
    individually or with python slices, and writing is done via assignment.

        common list operations (Sequence)

    Examples
    --------
    Read all traces in file f and store in a list:

    >>> l = [numpy.copy(tr) for tr in trace[:]]

    Do numpy operations on a trace:

    >>> tr = trace[10]
    >>> tr = tr * 2
    >>> tr = tr - 100
    >>> avg = numpy.average(tr)

    Perform some seismic processing on a trace. E.g resample from 2ms spacing
    to 4ms spacing (note there is no anti-alias filtering in this example):

    >>> tr = scipy.signal.resample(tr, len(tr)/2)

    Double every trace value and write to disk. Since accessing a trace
    gives a numpy value, to write to the respective trace we need its index:

    >>> for i, tr in enumerate(trace):
    ...     tr = tr * 2
    ...     trace[i] = tr

        ith trace of the file, starting at 0. trace[i] returns a numpy array,
        and changes to this array will *not* be reflected on disk.

        When i is a tuple, the second index j (int or slice) is the depth index
        or interval, respectively. j starts at 0.

        When i is a slice, a generator of numpy arrays is returned.

        .. note::

            This operator reads lazily from the file, meaning the file is read
            on ``next()``, and only one trace is fixed in memory. This means
            segyio can run through arbitrarily large files without consuming
            much memory, but it is potentially slow if the goal is to read the
            entire file into memory. If that is the case, consider using
            `trace.raw`, which reads eagerly.

        Examples
        --------
        Read every other trace:

        >>> for tr in trace[::2]:
        ...     print(tr)

        Read all traces, last-to-first:

        >>> for tr in trace[::-1]:
        ...     tr.mean()

        Read a single value. The second [] is regular numpy array indexing, and
        supports all numpy operations, including negative indexing and slicing:

        >>> trace[0][0]
        1490.2
        >>> trace[0][1]
        1490.8

    This mode gives access to reading and writing functionality of headers,

    implements a dict_like object with a fixed set of keys, given by the SEG-Y
    standard.

    The Header implements the array interface, where every array element, the
    data trace, is a numpy.ndarray. As all arrays, it can be random accessed,
    iterated over, and read strided. Data is read lazily from disk, so
    iteration does not consume much memory.
